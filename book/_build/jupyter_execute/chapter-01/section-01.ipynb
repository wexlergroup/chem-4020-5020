Course Introduction\n","\n","## Overview\n","\n","This course covers the fundamental concepts of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, along with their applications to chemical systems. It builds upon the thermodynamic principles introduced in [Chem 106](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-105-106) and [Chem 112](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-111-112), and the quantum mechanics taught in [Chem 105](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-105-106), [Chem 111](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/chemistry-111-112), and [Chem 401](https://chemistry.wustl.edu/physical-chemistry-i). By connecting molecular-level behavior to macroscopic thermodynamic observations, students will learn how theory underpins real-world chemical processes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Why Study Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics?\n","\n","### Bridging the Microscopic and Macroscopic Worlds\n","\n","Typical chemical systems contain on the order of [Avogadro's number](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?na) of particles (i.e., $N_\\text{A} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$). Thermodynamics abstracts the complexity of such large collections of molecules into a framework for predicting:\n","\n","- Reaction spontaneity,\n","- Equilibrium states,\n","- Phase transitions, and more.\n","\n","### Modern Applications\n","\n","Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are central to diverse fields, including industrial chemistry, materials science, and biochemistry.
