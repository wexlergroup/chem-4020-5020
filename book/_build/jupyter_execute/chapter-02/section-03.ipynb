Ensemble Averages\n","\n","## Overview\n","\n","In Section 2.1, we introduced the concept that *macroscopic properties are expected values of microscopic properties*, emphasizing that these expected values account for the probabilities of different microstates. In Section 2.2, we derived the probability distribution (in the canonical ensemble) for a closed system’s microstates. Now, in this section, we connect these ideas to calculate **ensemble averages** that determine macroscopic properties.\n","\n","## Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n","\n","Recall from Section 1.1 that **thermodynamic equilibrium** is a state of simultaneous mechanical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium.
