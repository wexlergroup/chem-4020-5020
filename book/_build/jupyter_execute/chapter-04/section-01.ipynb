Entropy\n","\n","## Overview\n","\n","In Module 3, we established the foundations of thermodynamics and explored the concept of enthalpy. We will learn that **exothermicity** (a negative enthalpy change) often favors spontaneity but does not fully determine it. The missing piece is **entropy**, a state function that provides crucial insight into the direction of spontaneous change. In this sub-module, we build on those ideas by formally introducing entropy, examining its definition, and understanding its role in the **arrow of time** for spontaneous processes.\n","\n","## Exothermicity and Spontaneity\n","\n","Exothermic reactions are often—but not always—spontaneous. An exothermic process releases heat to its surroundings, corresponding to a negative enthalpy change, $\\Delta H < 0$. While this heat release can drive a process forward, enthalpy alone does not guarantee spontaneity; we must also consider entropy.\n","\n","````{margin}\n","```{note}\n","$\\Delta H < 0$ is **exothermic**  \n","$\\Delta H > 0$ is **endothermic**\n","```\n","````\n","\n","### An Example: Formation of Liquid Water\n","\n","Consider the formation of two moles of liquid water from hydrogen and oxygen gases at 298.15 K and 1 bar:\n","\n","```{math}\n","\\ce{2H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2H2O(l)}\n","```\n","\n","The standard enthalpy change for this reaction is $-571.66$ kJ for two moles of H$_2$O(l), indicating an exothermic process. The reaction releases heat:\n","\n","```{admonition} Exothermicity in Chemical Terms\n",":class: tip\n","In chemical terms, **exothermicity** is often associated with the formation of stronger chemical bonds in the products than those in the reactants. In this example, forming $\\ce{H-O}$ bonds in water releases more energy than what was required to break $\\ce{H-H}$ and $\\ce{O=O}$ bonds.\n","```\n","\n","It is fortunate that water formation is exothermic, as this makes the reaction more likely to proceed spontaneously under standard conditions.\n","\n","### A Counter Example: Mixing of Two Ideal Gases\n","\n","If we mix two ideal gases, such as Ar and Kr, their intermolecular interactions are negligible (ideal-gas behavior), so $\\Delta H = 0$. Nonetheless, mixing occurs spontaneously once the partition is removed."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"03573df8","metadata":{"tags":["hide-input"]},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from scipy.constants import k, eV\n","from labellines import labelLines\n","from myst_nb import glue\n","\n","rng = np.random.default_rng(8251991)\n","\n","fig, axs = plt.subplot_mosaic([[0, 1]], figsize=(8, 4), constrained_layout=True, sharex=True, sharey=True)\n","\n","# Before\n","axs[0].set_title('Before Opening the Stopper')\n","x_Ar = rng.uniform(-4, 4, 6)\n","y_Ar = rng.uniform(2, 5, 6)\n","axs[0].scatter(x_Ar, y_Ar, color='r', label='Ar', s=100)\n","\n","x_Kr = rng.uniform(-4, 4, 6)\n","y_Kr = rng.uniform(-5, -2, 6)\n","axs[0].scatter(x_Kr, y_Kr, color='b', label='Kr', s=100)\n","\n","# Ar region\n","axs[0].plot([1, 1], [0, 1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([1, 5], [1, 1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([5, 5], [1, 6], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([5, -5], [6, 6], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([-5, -5], [6, 1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([-5, -1], [1, 1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([-1, -1], [1, 0], color='k')\n","\n","# Kr region\n","axs[0].plot([1, 1], [0, -1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([1, 5], [-1, -1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([5, 5], [-1, -6], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([5, -5], [-6, -6], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([-5, -5], [-6, -1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([-5, -1], [-1, -1], color='k')\n","axs[0].plot([-1, -1], [-1, 0], color='k')\n","\n","# Closed stopper\n","axs[0].plot([-1.5, 1.5], [0, 0], color='m', lw=2)\n","axs[0].text(2, 0, \"Stopper (closed)\", fontsize=10, ha='left', va='center', color='m')\n","axs[0].set_aspect('equal')\n","axs[0].axis('off')\n","\n","# After\n","axs[1].set_title('After Opening the Stopper')\n","x_Ar = rng.uniform(-4, 4, 6)\n","y_Ar_1 = rng.uniform(2, 5, 3)\n","y_Ar_2 = rng.uniform(-5, -2, 3)\n","y_Ar = np.concatenate((y_Ar_1, y_Ar_2))\n","axs[1].scatter(x_Ar, y_Ar, color='r', label='Ar', s=100)\n","\n","x_Kr = rng.uniform(-4, 4, 6)\n","y_Kr_1 = rng.uniform(2, 5, 3)\n","y_Kr_2 = rng.uniform(-5, -2, 3)\n","y_Kr = np.concatenate((y_Kr_1, y_Kr_2))\n","axs[1].scatter(x_Kr, y_Kr, color='b', label='Kr', s=100)\n","\n","axs[1].plot([1, 1], [0, 1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([1, 5], [1, 1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([5, 5], [1, 6], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([5, -5], [6, 6], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([-5, -5], [6, 1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([-5, -1], [1, 1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([-1, -1], [1, 0], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([1, 1], [0, -1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([1, 5], [-1, -1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([5, 5], [-1, -6], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([5, -5], [-6, -6], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([-5, -5], [-6, -1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([-5, -1], [-1, -1], color='k')\n","axs[1].plot([-1, -1], [-1, 0], color='k')\n","\n","# Open stopper\n","axs[1].plot([-5, -2], [0, 0], color='m', lw=2)\n","axs[1].text(2, 0, \"Stopper (open)\", fontsize=10, ha='left', va='center', color='m')\n","axs[1].axis('off')\n","axs[1].set_aspect('equal')\n","axs[1].legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left', borderaxespad=0.)\n","\n","fig.suptitle(r'$\\Delta H = 0$')\n","\n","glue(\"gases_before_after\", fig, display=False)\n","plt.close(fig)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5a4e8103","metadata":{},"source":["```{glue:figure} gases_before_after\n",":figwidth: 100%\n",":align: center\n","\n","Mixing of two ideal gases before and after opening the stopper that separates them.\n","```\n","\n","Even though $\\Delta H = 0$, the process is still **spontaneous**.
